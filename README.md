# Cardio_CRISPR_screen

This repository is for sharing an analysis to prioritize ~12k cardiomyocyte genes to perturb in order to understand siRNA-based therapeutic delivery.

This is not a published project, so not all data is available. In particular, the "liangfu" dataset referenced in the project is not yet available.

To rerun this pipeline, use snakemake=7.32.4.
This pipeline is intended to run on an HPC using slurm.
The pipeline is completely self-contained (save for the currently unpublished dataset).
